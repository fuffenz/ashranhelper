AshranHelper is a simple WoW addon.  It was made for personal use but could probably be useful for others. :)


It currently does 3 different things, all related to the PvP zone Ashran.


1)  When you are in queue for Ashran and get the invite popup, it will play a sound.  I never understood why the default UI does not already, but a sound helps if you are tabbed out to another window or temporary AFKish.

2)  It filters out those annoying "Broken bones" loot messages.  Don't worry, you will still get your bones if you're collecting them, you just wont see the spammy messages in chat.

3)  It provides you with a simple auto-invite feature.   You need to create a raid group or join one where you have assist and are able to invite others.  

Enable or disable the auto-invite feature with 

/ashranhelper auto

When enabled, it will check for "inv" or "invite" messages in /say, General-Ashran and in whispers.  The sender will be invited to your group automagically.  This will only trigger when you are in Ashran and in a raid group, so you can usually keep this option enabled all the time.  If needed, use /ashranhelper auto again to disable it.
